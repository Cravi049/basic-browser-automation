# Basic Browser Automation for Security Testing

## üìå Overview
This is a simple cybersecurity project built during my Penetration Testing Internship at **Deltaware Solutions**.  
The goal of this project is to automate basic web security testing tasks using **Python + Selenium**.

The script simulates a human tester by:
- Opening a website automatically.
- Checking for a login form and attempting a test login with dummy credentials.
- Capturing a screenshot of the page as proof of execution.

This project is beginner-friendly and shows the use of **Python in security automation**.
